# Inl-mningsUppgift3

This is a School project about algorithms, clean code, and SOLID principles. 

The program is a Swing application that allows the user to make their own arrays, or load arrays from a csv, and then chose 1 out of 5 algorithms to sort it. 
The user can type in their own arrays and save them to the csv, and the user can choose to save the sorted array to the corresponding row in another csv file.
